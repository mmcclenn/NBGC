# 
# Main model file
# ---------------
# 
# This file is the main file for the entire model; various parts can be found
# in the files included below.
# 
# This is a reference implementation of the Biome-BGC model, intended to be
# validated against the existing code of version 4.  Once that validation is
# complete, we can proceed to add new variables and processes and create a new
# version.
# 
# Authors (in rough historical sequence) of this model and associated
# computer code:
# 
# S. W. Running
# Stith T. Gower
# Douglas Ahl
# Peter Thornton
# Ben Bond-Lamberty
# Scott Peckham
# Michael McClennen
